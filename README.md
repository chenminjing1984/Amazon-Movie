Supervised learning model to measure the movie cumulated view time per day

This project used supervised learning models to predict Amazon prime video's view time per day based on the features, like the position on the webpage, genres of the movies, release year, budget, box office and ects. 

Data binning and one hot encoding technique was used for categorical feature pre-processing.

comparing model performance between Lasso, ridge (both monomial and polynomial) and random forest.

Used grid search cross validation to selected hyperparameter to achieve the best performance of the models.

Select the most influential feature by feature importance for business purpose.
